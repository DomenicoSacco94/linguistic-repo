## German reading excercise app

This is the FE for an app that can help you practice German. 
You can paste a text and get a translation for each single word (by clicking on it) or for the whole sentence (by clicking the **>** icon).
The app allows you to import a text file for doing the same.

The sentence translations are cached on your local browser, so you can read in the Metro in peace, without worrying about the internet connection :D.

For longer texts, a pagination mechanism is implemented ;-)
